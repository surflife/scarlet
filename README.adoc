This repository has been setup to use with a test for Operations Engineer Applicants for a company I'm helping hire for.
The code is *very* heavily based on the spring-boot rest server example.  
To go through that example visit the spring-boot tutorial: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/

== Running Maven Build
This repository is setup to use maven to build the package for deployment

Running maven to build a package for this deployment would look something like this `mvn package`
